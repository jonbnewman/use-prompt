# Async/await and try/catch

This example demonstrates how to use async/await and try/catch in order to retrieve what the users response within the prompt was.

The essential piece to take from this is that the `showPrompt` callback returns a promise that represents the outcome of the prompt. You can either `resolve` or `reject` it and return the result to the caller as you might expect.

Note that you don't **have to** use `try/catch`, you can just always `resolve` from within your prompt and then only worry about the result returned from the promise.
