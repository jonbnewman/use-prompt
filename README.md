# use-prompt

**use-prompt** is a library that lets you conveniently display a component to a user asynchronously.

This allows you to ask a user for input, display a message, or do whatever you want in an asynchronous manner. It supports N-number of concurrent prompt support, and allows you to render anywhere you like.

### Coming soon, see the [release milestone](https://github.com/jonbnewman/use-prompt/milestone/1).
