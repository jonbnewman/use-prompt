**use-prompt** is a library that lets you conveniently display a React component to a user asynchronously.

This allows you to ask a user for input, prompt for an answer, display a message, or do whatever you want in an asynchronous manner.

Features:

- Promise-based (async and try/catch capable).
- N-number of concurrent prompt support.
- Render anywhere you like.

### Coming soon, see the [release milestone](https://github.com/jonbnewman/use-prompt/milestone/1).
